Guidelines for noIM/WW Glitched Logic

1) All in-logic tricks being considered need to be infinitely repeatable with no ability to softlock the game logically by themselves
2) Difficulty is not a factor
3) Obscurity is not a factor


Tricks not considered at all
Item Manipulation
	BA
	RBA
	GIM

Ocarina Items
	Can dupe over beans, losing them forever

Equip Swap
	Bottle over Din's Fire, lost forever

Wrong warpping
	All sorts. FWWWs, void warps, and blue warp manips included.  These are too vastly misunderstood and non-repeatable to be considered.
